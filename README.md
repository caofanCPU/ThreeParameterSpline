# ThreeParameterSpline
This paper regards the study of cubic parametric spline interpolation function as the breakthrough point, by choosing suitable type value points to construct the cam contour curve fitting, with the purpose to design a complete cam follower grinding task simulation algorithm, which of the cam with the grinding dynamic mathematical modeling. And the point of tangency dynamic follows fitting error compensation. With the use of Matlab simulation to simulate the cam follower grinding task, the cam profile curve function analytic formula with high accuracy can be obtained. Through analyzing the cam contour curve fitting error data, determination of the cam grinding dynamic mathematical model with dynamic fully meets the requirements of the precision of the workpiece cam designing for the high precision cam product, which will lay a strong foundation for the mass production manufacture.
